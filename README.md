# Customer Conversion Funnel Analysis and Optimization

Customer analytics project applying funnel analysis, behavioral analytics, and operational diagnostics to identify root causes of declining conversion rates and recommend data-driven product and operational improvements.

---

## Executive Summary

This project analyzed customer behavior and funnel performance to diagnose declining conversion rates on a digital platform. The analysis identified key behavioral and operational drivers of performance decline, including mobile experience friction, inventory availability constraints, and drop-offs between product view and add-to-cart stages.

The findings informed targeted product, operational, and inventory optimization recommendations to improve conversion performance, customer experience, and overall platform efficiency. This project demonstrates how analytics can be used to diagnose system performance issues and guide data-driven product and operational decision-making.

## Overview

This project investigates declining conversion rates for an e-commerce platform by analyzing customer behavior, funnel performance, traffic sources, device usage, and inventory availability. The goal was to identify key drivers of conversion decline and recommend targeted improvements to increase customer engagement and revenue.

Understanding user behavior and identifying friction points in digital workflows is critical for improving performance in modern digital platforms, including healthcare systems, patient portals, and AI-enabled applications.

## Business Problem

The organization experienced declining conversion rates despite stable traffic volume and engagement metrics. This suggested performance bottlenecks within the customer journey, product experience, or operational infrastructure.

Key challenges included:

• Declining conversion rates despite consistent traffic levels  
• Limited visibility into behavioral drivers of performance decline  
• Unknown friction points within the customer conversion funnel  
• Potential operational constraints affecting conversion performance  

Identifying and resolving these issues is essential to improving system performance, user engagement, and overall business outcomes.

## Approach

The analysis examined customer behavior across the full conversion funnel:

Visits → Product Views → Add to Cart → Checkout → Order Completion

Key analytical steps included:

• Funnel conversion rate analysis  
• Week-over-week performance analysis  
• Customer segmentation (new vs. returning users)  
• Channel-level performance analysis  
• Device-level performance analysis  
• Inventory and out-of-stock impact analysis  

This structured approach enabled identification of behavioral, product, and operational drivers of performance decline.

---

## Key Findings

The analysis identified several primary drivers of declining conversion performance:

• Significant drop-off between product views and add-to-cart actions  
• Reduced conversion performance on mobile devices  
• Lower conversion rates among returning users  
• Inventory constraints affecting product availability  
• Conversion performance decline across multiple acquisition channels  

These findings indicated both user experience and operational factors impacting platform performance.

---

## Business Impact and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, several high-impact product and operational improvements were identified:

• Improve product page design and usability to increase add-to-cart conversion  
• Optimize mobile user experience to reduce friction in the customer journey  
• Improve inventory allocation and availability for high-demand products  
• Improve performance and targeting of acquisition channels  
• Prioritize optimization efforts at key funnel bottlenecks  

These recommendations support improved system performance, higher conversion rates, and improved user experience.

## Healthcare and Digital Health Relevance

The analytical methods used in this project are directly applicable to healthcare and digital health platforms, where system performance, patient engagement, and workflow efficiency are critical. Similar funnel and behavioral analytics techniques are used in healthcare systems to analyze patient journeys, identify workflow bottlenecks, improve engagement, and optimize digital health platforms.

These capabilities are highly relevant to healthcare analytics, AI-enabled healthcare systems, and regulated digital health environments.
