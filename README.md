# Customer Conversion Funnel Analysis and Optimization

Customer analytics project analyzing user behavior, funnel performance, and operational constraints to identify root causes of declining conversion rates and recommend data-driven improvements to digital platform performance.

---

## Overview

This project investigates declining conversion rates for an e-commerce platform by analyzing customer behavior, funnel performance, traffic sources, device usage, and inventory availability. The goal was to identify key drivers of conversion decline and recommend targeted improvements to increase customer engagement and revenue.

This analysis demonstrates how data analytics can be used to diagnose product performance issues, improve digital experiences, and support data-driven product and operational decision-making.

## Business Problem

The organization experienced declining conversion rates despite stable traffic volume and engagement metrics. This suggested potential issues within the customer journey, product experience, or operational infrastructure.

Key challenges included:

• Declining conversion rates despite consistent traffic levels  
• Unknown points of friction within the customer funnel  
• Potential user experience or inventory-related issues  
• Limited visibility into behavioral drivers of performance decline  

Understanding where and why users drop off in the funnel is critical for improving conversion and business performance.

## Approach

The analysis examined customer behavior across the full conversion funnel:

Visits → Product Views → Add to Cart → Checkout → Order Completion

Key analytical steps included:

• Funnel conversion rate analysis  
• Week-over-week performance comparison  
• Channel-level performance analysis  
• Customer segmentation (new vs returning users)  
• Device-level performance analysis  
• Inventory and out-of-stock impact analysis  

This approach enabled identification of behavioral and operational constraints impacting conversion.

## Key Findings

The analysis identified several primary drivers of declining conversion rates:

• Significant drop-off between product views and add-to-cart actions  
• Reduced conversion performance on mobile devices  
• Lower conversion rates among returning users  
• High out-of-stock exposure in high-demand product categories  
• Conversion decline across multiple acquisition channels  

These findings indicated both user experience and operational factors contributing to performance decline.

## Business Impact and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, several high-impact recommendations were identified:

• Improve product page user experience to increase add-to-cart rates  
• Optimize mobile user experience to reduce funnel friction  
• Improve inventory allocation and availability for high-demand products  
• Improve targeting and efficiency of marketing channels  
• Prioritize improvements at key funnel bottlenecks  

These improvements support increased conversion rates, improved customer experience, and higher revenue performance.
